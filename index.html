Each train car will represent a different project for the portfolio, and the user will be able to navigate the various train cars to explore the portfolio in an interesting way. </div> </div> <div id="follow-text-two" class="follow-text"> <div class="title-one"> Ship It </div> <div class="collaborator"> By Skyler Haataja </div> <div class="box"></div> <div class="explain"> Lead modeler for our senior capstone game. Ship It is a dating sim with a 2.5D style inspired by the style of Octopath Traveler. I Made all of my models in blender and imported them into Unreal Engine 5. I modeled and textured the bar, movie theatre, club, and the ship's structure. This project taught me more about texturing, baking, lighting, and blender's tools than anything project prior. </div> <div class="stPic"> <img src="https://jontyjlewis.github.io/TrainPortfolio/skl01.ff0d059e.png" alt="skl01"> </div> </div> <div id="follow-text-three" class="follow-text"> <div class="title-one"> Seasonal Fractal Tree </div> <div class="collaborator"> By Jonathan Lewis and Joe Frumenti </div> <div class="box"></div> <div class="explain"> A tree made using fractals coded in p5.js that cycles between being dormant and fully grown full of leaves with autumn colors </div> <div class="stPic"> <img src="https://jontyjlewis.github.io/TrainPortfolio/jty01.8b5de1dc.png" alt="jty01"> </div> </div> <div id="follow-text-four" class="follow-text"> <div class="title-one"> Gotta Moon </div> <div class="collaborator"> By Joe Frumenti's 172 Team </div> <div class="box"></div> <div class="explain"> Gotta Moon is a game that I developed in collaboration with a team of eight individuals during a 2-week game jam. Our task was to rectify a flawed and unstable project and ensure that it was user-friendly. I undertook the demanding responsibility of analyzing countless lines of unorganized code, in addition to implementing key features such as personalized turn acceleration, elastic deformation animations, and more. </div> <div class="stPic"> <img src="https://jontyjlewis.github.io/TrainPortfolio/GottaMoon.50157212.gif" alt="brt02"> </div> </div> <div id="follow-text-five" class="follow-text"> <div class="title-one"> Cyber City in the Dark </div> <div class="collaborator"> By X.Christopher Zhang </div> <div class="box"></div> <div class="explain"> Cyber cities are always simple but brilliant. Cyber pursues a minimalist style, but it is luxurious and mysterious. I hope to find inspiration in cubes with anamorphic overlays and render them in a relatively understated cyber-dominant color style. They could be predominantly silver with dark, towering skyscrapers. I will try to embellish them with some small but harsh light sources to highlight their mysterious and advanced feeling. </div> <div class="stPic"> <img src="https://jontyjlewis.github.io/TrainPortfolio/xcr01.546a0e4a.jpg" alt="xcr01"> </div> </div> <script src="https://jontyjlewis.github.io/TrainPortfolio/index.c3f755f2.js"></script> <script src="https://jontyjlewis.github.io/TrainPortfolio/index.f8c7fb3e.js" type="module"></script> </body></html>
